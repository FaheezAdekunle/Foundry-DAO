# Introduction

DAOs(Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are blockchain based entities that operates without central authority.

# About

In this repo, I demonstrated the core functions of DAO and implemented governance in such a way that allows the users make quick decisions by using the timelock concept. This concept gives users time to reflect on a proposal before it is executed.

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-dao-cu
cd foundry-dao-cu
forge install
forge build
```

# Usage

## Test

```
forge test
```
## Deploy

I did not write deploy scripts for this project, you can if you'd like!

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:

```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see and output file called `.gas-snapshot`


# Formatting


To run code formatting:
```
forge fmt
```
